<p >Conor has the same dream every night,
     ever<br> since his mother first fell ill, 
     ever since she<br> started the treatments that don't quite seem <br>to be working.
      But tonight is different.<br> Tonight, when he wakes,
       there's a visitor at<br> his window. Itâ€™s ancient, elemental, a force<br> of nature.
        And it wants the most dangerous<br> thing of all from Conor. It wants the truth.<br>
         Patrick Ness takes the final idea of the late,<br>
          award-winning writer Siobhan Dowd and<br> weaves an extraordinary and heartbreaking <br>tale of mischief, healing and above all, 
    the <br>courage it takes to survive.<br><br>
